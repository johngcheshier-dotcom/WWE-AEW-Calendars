# WWE + AEW Calendars — v2.2 Core (Trimmed)

This is the **super clean** build: no alternates, no placeholders. All links point to:

```

## Quick Start
1. Upload this folder to your GitHub repo root (`WWE-AEW-Calendars`).
2. In Google Calendar (web): **Other calendars → From URL**. Paste URLs from the READY lists below.

### READY Lists
- `CORE_URLS_READY.txt` — 13 curated URLs for everyday use.
- `FULL_URLS_READY.txt` — every feed included in this trimmed build (15 total).

**Do not use Import.** Subscribing From URL keeps calendars auto-updating.
